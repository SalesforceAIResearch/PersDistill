Complete the python function to solve the following task. The input format is 

TASK: << Some Task description >> 
HEADER: << Header of the python function definition. Your output should start with this header >> 

Example 

TASK: <<TASK>> 

HEADER: <<HEADER>>

CORRECT CODE: 


==========================================

Now act like a python expert, whose objective is to give feedback on an incorrect code implemented for the above task and then also rectify it. 

INCORRECT CODE: <<CODE>>

Give your output in two steps:

### Instruction on Step 1: Feedback Generation: 
- Start with "Step 1: FEEDBACK: Mistakes in the code "
- Based on your correct code, detect and output a list of mistakes in the incorrect code.  

### Instruction on Step 2: Code Rectification:
- Start with "Step 2: RECTIFIED CODE "
- Rectify the logic of the incorrect code and write a complete python function to correctly solve the task. 
- If the given code is significantly wrong then you can completely re-write the code, otherwise try to come up with a correct version that is closest to the given code.
- All output code should be inside code block ``` ```.
